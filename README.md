Unity Game called Fish Sticks by Lexi Lewis and Rebekah Walls

A few notes on Fish

For a "normal fish" the following should be attached:
1. Sprite Render
2. Rigidbody 2d
3. Drag and Drop Script (attach audio clips and prefabs for sprites and effects)
4. Random Patrol script (values are -8.37, 3.56,-4.78, 4.79, 2, 5, 60)
5. Capsule Collider 2d
6. Audio source (uncheck play on awake and loop, volume at about .4)

For a Growing fish
replace drag and drop script with the grow fish script

For a Speedy fish
replace Random Patrol Script with the SpeedyRandomPatrol Script
replace Drag and Drop with SpeedFish Script
